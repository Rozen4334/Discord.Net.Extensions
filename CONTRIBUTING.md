## 🔢 Versioning

Discord.Net.Extensions aims to project Discord.Net versioning. This mean semantic versioning is expected:

- We will only increment `MAJOR` versioning if a breaking change is made in Discord or in this extension. 

- We will only increment `MINOR` versioning if a new feature is introduced or a number of patches are ready to be released.

- We will only increment `PATCH` if a patch must immediately be pushed as it breaks the flow of the extension.
